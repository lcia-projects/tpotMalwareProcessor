# tpotMalwareArchiver
Simple Script to archive TSEC TPOT20 malware samples for analysis at a later date

All this script does is goes through the folders listed in the settings.yaml and rename 
the .tgz archives to a unique name (hostname)+honeypotname+type_of_data.tgz then move that file into 
a transfer folder. 

next time the script is run, the files in the transfer folder and moved to "archive" and 
zipped up in a monthly zip file. Then new malware samples are renamed and 
put in the transfer folder. 

##### Example configuration file:
- rootFolder: "/data" # root folder of tpot data, typically "/data"

- malwareSubFolders: ["/adbhoney","/cowrie","/dionaea"]  #list of subfolders containing malware archives you want to rename

- completeFolder: "./Transfer" # where to put the files after renaming them

- archiveFolder: "./Archive" # where to archive them
